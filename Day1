7:20 proxmox installed on desktop
7:30 proxmox kerenal panic 
7:45 proxmox version was changed and reinstalled proxmox now running 

followed this ()[]
8:00 copied .ova from laptop to proxmox 
9:00 extracted .ova to get vmdk 
9:10 converted vmdk to qcow2 format
9:20 created a test virtual machine
9:30 importing qcow2 file complete
9:35 started vm, did not boot

troubleshooting
9:40 tried replacing machine types, firmware from seabios to ovme
9:45 ovme requires efi storage, so created efi storage for importing
10:00 created new vm with different configuration to hopefully match the iso
10:15 imported the qcow2 file again and started the vm no luck
10:30 on virtualbox created a vm and exported the appliance to ova
10:40 uploaded iso file to proxmox and tried to create vm with it (works)
10:50 appliance exported, and copied to proxmox
11:15 ova file again extrated and process repeated, works

documentation
qm create 
qm set 
qm start
qm stop
qm destroy
qm list

what i learnet
default configurations that vbox ship ova images needs to be known to properly import the vms
    bios/uefi
    chipset (machine)
there might be alternate ways to migrate a machine to proxmox

tasks to be done for next 
1. find proper way to export centos based vms from virtualbox
2. find alternate ways for imgrating
